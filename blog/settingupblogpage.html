                    HTML CSS and JavaScript are all vital parts of creating this blog page. Most of what I did here was learned from constantly tinkering with websites of the like and a 
                    little bit from schooling. I utilized flexboxes while structuring the skeleton of my HTML to ensure the blog posts would wrap around and be responsive to the userâ€™s
                    screen resolution. The theory is to have an outer box with its content oriented either horizontal or vertical with each internal box doing the same creating a dotted
                    box sort of alignment, of which you can be highly customizable. My favorite feature within the blog portion of my web portfolio is the listed out posts that have an on
                    scroll effect, something I have never utilized in the past. I used AOS (an animate on scroll library) and simply attached the "data-aos" style to whichever element
                    I wanted to have that effect. I would have loved to utilize SSI (server side includes) although GitHub pages do not support the use 
                    of PHP. Which leads me to the idea of migrating to another site eventually. I imported font awesome CSS for the social media icons and various styling that can be 
                    found through out the site even outside of the blog portion. As this post is being created, I am working to utilize JavaScript to include some better features and 
                    effects. For example, creating a photo gallery for my Tip Out Web Application to include all the relevant coding that went along with that project.
