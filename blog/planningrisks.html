                    I found out first hand why it is important to plan for potential risks and implications during the development of a project. While working on my 
                    <a href="../blog/tipout.html" class="bloglink">Web Application</a> back in 2020 we faced many road blocks!
                    We prepared a risk register and determined risk factor for each risk and of the five we calculated three of them had to be acted on. 
                    Teammates unable to continue with the project, not completing the project on time, and lack of relevant coding experience within the team were all issues that we faced. 
                    The decision was to utilize Django frameworks because it offered a higher level of security than the other frameworks we considered, even though it was 
                    collectively unfamiliar to the entire team. This decision was made under the impression that we would be working on a timeline unhindered by external factors,
                    most notably Covid-19. It quickly became apparent that my colleagues and I were unable to give as much time to learning a new framework than was originally 
                    planned and our timeline had gotten pushed back further than anticipated. This is where we benefited from creating a risk register and a backup plan! We dropped our 
                    progress up until this point and migrated over to NodeJS, our second choice of a framework after Django due to our familiarity and experience working with it. 
                    While I do advise not switch frameworks as it is time consuming and you can run into many issues doing so, this was the best option due to our time constraints.
