                    Introduction to The Project <br><br>
                    Texas Jacks Barbeque is a BBQ Joint located in Annandale and has been one of my favorite spots for some time so it was a very rewarding experience for me to help them
                    on the technical side of things.
                    The goal for me and my team was to create a Tip-Out web applications for Texas Jacks Barbeque. With our point of contact having so many requirements for the 
                    web application on top of 2020 being one of the craziest years, front to back, this project took place over the course of one year (1/2020 - 12/2020). To give a high 
                    level overview of the issue we were tasked to solve: create a Web Application to replace the current tip out system and integrate their POS (point of sale) into 
                    the system for automation.

                    Current Business Problems & Proposed Solutions <br><br>
                    The manager at that time created an extensive excel sheet in liue of not having a script or program to sync up with the POS and automate the tip out for each
                    employee at the end of their shift. Relevant information about an individuals tips throughout their shift was printed and pulled as a CSV file, from aloha, which was
                    then manually input into the excel sheet. A big time sink for any manager to be handeling especially considering they are a busy resturant. Our proposed solutions

                        Aloha had a stricter firewall and specalized security therefore <br> the bot we created to extract the data had to be <br> tested on a native device.
