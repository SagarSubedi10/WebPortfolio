                    Overview <br><br>
                    This certification, according to the AWS guidelines, should take a new user roughly two to four months to obtain. This cert is the foundation for everything cloud based, 
                    a ninety-minute multiple choice / multiple answer exam that costs $100 and is administered in any testing center.

                    Preparation <br><br>
                    The recommended two to four months needed to prepare for this certification refers to someone who as little to no technical experience. If you are familiar with this 
                    technology or have a background in computer preparation for this certification should take no longer than a one to three weeks, at most. My preparation consisted of 
                    using YouTube videos and the provided white papers from the AWS site. Sites like Udemy and Whizlabs will offer new users a better guideline to learning this material if
                    previously unfamiliar. 
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content2">
                <h2>
                    Take Away <br><br>
                    You will find a majority of what is tested on this certification to be very useful even if you decide not to venture deeper into the world of cloud, although you should.
                    You could even skip over this certification and go straight into an Associate or Specialty level certification, but it never hurts to brush up on old skills.
                    I obtained this certification during a weeklong break from school to keep myself active and fresh. I get stretched thin thinking about all the technologies that I 
                    would like to test out and learn, although in the future I would be interested in obtaining my AWS SysOps Administrator Associate Certification. From what I have
                    gathered the AWS Certification Cloud Practitioner serves as a good steppingstone for the next certs and should not be looked over.
